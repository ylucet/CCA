Computational Convex Analysis Library for univariate functions

The copyright model used is to ask all contributor to the code source for all rights to be assigned to the PI (Yves Lucet). Then selected parts of the code are released under various licenses (code in Netlib is public domain, other parts were released as GPL). 

- The very first version was coded in Pascal, and released as public domain 1997.
- An initial version was coded for Maple, and released as GPL around 2004.
- (A partial translation into C was never completed, and never released, 1998.) 
- The current version is coded for Scilab, 2004- and released under GPL 3.0+
- A MATLAB version was released in 2017 under GPL 3.0+
